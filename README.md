How to Use:

Install Dependencies:

pip install requests pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn

Configure FHIR Server (Optional): Replace 'http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient' with the actual URL of your FHIR server. If you want to use the example bundle, no need to change the url.
Run the Script:

python your_script_name.py
Important Notes:

The sepsis labels are randomly assigned for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to use actual clinical data to label patients.
This script provides a basic example and may need to be modified to fit specific requirements.
Judges can test the script with the provided example patient bundle, or by changing the use_example_bundle variable to False, and providing a valid FHIR server URL.
The script includes SMOTE to handle class imbalance, which is a common issue in medical datasets.
